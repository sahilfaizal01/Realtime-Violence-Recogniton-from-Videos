# Realtime-Violence-Recogniton-from-Videos
This is a computer vision project to recognise violence in real-time from videos.

# Notes:
1) Why use TimeDistributed layer instead of Dense layer? <br>
Because we want to keep each timestep value seperate, as in the TimeDistributed layer we apply a dense layer on each timestep.
